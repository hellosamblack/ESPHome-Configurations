    # Don't auto start BLE scanning, we control it in the `api` block's automation.
    continuous: False
    active: True  # send scan-request packets to gather more info, like device name for some devices.
    interval: 1000ms  # default 320ms - how long to spend on each advert channel
    window:   900ms  # default 30ms, try 300 - how long to actually "listen" in each interval. Reduce this if device is unstable.
    # If the device cannot keep up or becomes unstable, reduce the "window" setting. This may be
    # required if your device is controlling other sensors or doing PWM for lights etc.
  active: true  # allows outbound connections from HA to devices.
